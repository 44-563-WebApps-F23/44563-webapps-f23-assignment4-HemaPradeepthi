        HALVARD SOLNESS comes in through the hall door. He is a man no
        longer young, but healthy and vigorous, with close-cut curly
        hair, dark moustache and dark thick eyebrows. He wears a
        greyish-green buttoned jacket with an upstanding collar and
        broad lapels. On his head he wears a soft grey felt hat,
        and he has one or two light portfolios under his arm.]</p>
